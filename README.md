(If you dont have a complete understanding of financial investing please read the linked articles)

Gather stock data from yahoo and add ema based on adjusted close. - https://bit.ly/3mmJ31e
Backtest a particular method of trading stocks to give the user better insight on what works best. - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp
Scrub through 1,000s of stocks on an excel sheet to find the highest ranking price to sales ratios. - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-salesratio.asp

The goal of this project was to create a program that autoamated task that investors would have to do manually.

Using a yahoo api I was able to gather data directly from yahoo and add an ema.
This is usefule because it allows the user to instantly see if a stock meets his/her desired requirements.

Backtesting is  a great tool because it allows you to implement differnet methods of trading to understand which works better.
In the future more methods of trading will be added and a feature to compare 100s of results.
This can be a great data project!

Some sectors do better when there is a high price to sales ratio.
I made this program so the typical investor can just run a search on what stocks are preforming the best and add it to their watchlist

This project is still NOT complete.

A completed version would be able to create whats called a value sheet.

This was the project that motivated me to learn coding so its very special to me.
